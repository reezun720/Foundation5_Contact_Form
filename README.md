# Foundation5_Contact_Form
A generally used contact form with validation added to it using Foundation 5

I have included the Foundation 5 framework and the necessary js, and css to get a general sense of how it would work.

Add your own email address to the submission.php file which is included as well.  If you system is not setup to send php to your email add it to to your online server and it should work.
